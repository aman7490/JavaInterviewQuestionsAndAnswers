Here’s a concise and well-structured explanation of **HashMap internal implementation in Java**, suitable for proper notes:

---

### ✅ **HashMap Internal Implementation in Java**

#### 1. **Basic Structure**

* `HashMap<K, V>` stores key-value pairs.
* Internally uses an **array of Nodes** (also known as buckets).
* Each bucket is a **linked list or balanced tree** (if many collisions occur).

#### 2. **Node Class (Static Inner Class)**

```java
static class Node<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
    final int hash;
    final K key;
    V value;
    Node<K,V> next;  // For linked list chaining

    // constructor and other methods
}
```

#### 3. **Key Concepts**

| Concept                | Description                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hashing**            | Uses `hashCode()` of the key and converts it to a bucket index using `hash % capacity`.                           |
| **Bucket**             | An index in the array which may contain multiple Nodes (if collisions occur).                                     |
| **Collision Handling** | By **chaining** (linked list) and from Java 8 onwards, uses **balanced tree (TreeNode)** if >8 nodes in a bucket. |
| **Rehashing**          | When size exceeds **load factor × capacity**, a new array of double size is created and all entries are rehashed. |
| **Load Factor**        | Default is **0.75**, used to control rehashing threshold.                                                         |
| **Capacity**           | Default capacity is **16** (must be power of 2).                                                                  |

#### 4. **Important Methods**

* `put(K key, V value)`

    * Calculate hash → find bucket → check for existing key.
    * If exists, update value.
    * Else, add new Node at head or convert to TreeNode.
* `get(Object key)`

    * Compute hash → go to bucket → iterate over linked list or tree to match key.
* `remove(Object key)`

    * Locate key → remove from list/tree → fix structure.

#### 5. **Hash Function Improvement**

```java
static final int hash(Object key) {
    int h;
    return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);
}
```

* This improves randomness and reduces collisions.

#### 6. **Treeification Threshold**

* When a single bucket has **> 8 entries**, it’s converted to a **Red-Black Tree** (only if capacity >= 64).
* Helps in improving performance from O(n) to O(log n) in worst-case lookups.

QUESTION: how many byucket we can have

In a **Java `HashMap`**, the number of **buckets** is equal to its **capacity**, which is the size of the internal array used to store entries.

### ✅ Key Points About Buckets:

1. **Default Bucket Count**

    * The default number of buckets (capacity) is **16**.

2. **Bucket Count = Capacity**

    * Capacity is always a **power of 2** (e.g., 16, 32, 64...).

3. **Maximum Capacity**

    * The maximum number of buckets `HashMap` can have is:
      **2³⁰ = 1,073,741,824 buckets**
      (defined by `MAXIMUM_CAPACITY` in the source code)

4. **How Buckets Are Chosen**

    * A key's hash code is used to determine the bucket index:

      ```java
      index = (n - 1) & hash;
      ```

      where `n` is the current capacity (number of buckets).

5. **Rehashing Doubles the Bucket Count**

    * When the size exceeds the threshold (capacity × load factor), HashMap increases its capacity (number of buckets) to the **next power of two**, effectively doubling it.

---

### 🚀 Example

| Load Factor | Capacity (Buckets) | Threshold (when resize happens) |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0.75        | 16                 | 12                              |
| 0.75        | 32                 | 24                              |
| 0.75        | 64                 | 48                              |

QUESTION: in each bucket how many packets we can save

In each **bucket** of a Java `HashMap`, the number of **packets (entries)** that can be stored is **technically unlimited**, but here’s how it works in practice:

---

### ✅ In Each Bucket:

A **bucket** can store:

* **1 or more entries** (key-value pairs)
* When multiple keys hash to the **same bucket index** (due to collision), the entries are stored in that bucket in one of the following structures:

| Structure Type     | When Used                    | Access Time Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Linked List**    | Default for collisions       | O(n)                   |
| **Red-Black Tree** | If > 8 entries in one bucket | O(log n)               |

---

### 📌 Limits in Practice

| Parameter                     | Value                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Linked list → Tree**        | If **more than 8 entries** in a bucket  |
| **Tree → List (untreeify)**   | If size goes back below **6**           |
| **Minimum capacity for tree** | Only happens if total capacity ≥ **64** |

So, while **Java doesn’t cap** how many entries a bucket can hold, **performance degrades** if collisions are high and **hashing isn’t well distributed**.

---

### 🚨 Key Insight

> The more packets (entries) in one bucket, the **worse the performance**, especially if it's just a linked list. That’s why **good hash functions** and **resizing** are crucial.

--------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION: suppose 1 bucket has 1 to 10 index then what will be the index sequence of another bucket

Great question — but there seems to be a **misunderstanding** here.

In Java's `HashMap`, **each bucket corresponds to a single index** in an internal array — not a range like 1 to 10.

Let me clarify it for you:

---

### ✅ Internal Structure

* A `HashMap` uses an **array of buckets** (e.g., `Node<K,V>[] table`).
* Each **bucket** resides at a **single index** of this array.
* For example, with capacity 16, you have:

  ```
  table[0], table[1], ..., table[15]  ← 16 buckets
  ```

---

### 🚫 Misconception

> **"1 bucket has 1 to 10 index"** – This is incorrect. A bucket doesn't span multiple indexes.

---

### ✅ Correct Concept

If your current bucket is at **index 1**, then:

* The **next bucket** is simply at **index 2**.
* There’s no such thing as a bucket covering "1 to 10" — each index represents **exactly one bucket**.

---

### 💡 How Entry Is Mapped to a Bucket

When you do:

```java
map.put(key, value);
```

Java computes:

```java
bucketIndex = (n - 1) & hash(key);
```

where `n` is the capacity (number of buckets), and `hash(key)` is the improved hash.

---

### 🧠 Visual Example (Capacity = 16)

| Bucket Index | Possible Keys Stored |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| 0            | keyA, keyF           |
| 1            | keyB                 |
| 2            | (empty)              |
| 3            | keyC, keyG           |
| ...          | ...                  |
| 15           | keyD, keyE           |

Each index is a **bucket**. If multiple keys hash to the same index, they go into the same bucket (as linked list or tree).

---

-----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION: ok you mean we can store multiple packets in 1 bucket 

Excellent question. We **double the number of buckets (capacity)** in a `HashMap` during **rehashing** to maintain **efficient performance**.

---

### ✅ Reason for Doubling Buckets: To Reduce Collisions

#### 🔴 Problem Without Doubling:

* When the number of entries increases but bucket count stays the same, **more collisions** happen.
* This causes **longer linked lists or deeper trees** in each bucket.
* Lookup, insert, and delete operations become **slower** (O(n) or O(log n)).

---

### ✅ What Doubling Does:

| Action                                | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Double capacity**                   | From 16 → 32 → 64 → ...                                     |
| **Redistribute entries**              | Based on new hash index: `(new capacity - 1) & hash`        |
| **Reduce average entries per bucket** | Minimizes collisions                                        |
| **Improves performance**              | Keeps time complexity near **O(1)** for `get()` and `put()` |

---

### 🔍 Technical Behavior

* Happens when:

  ```java
  size > capacity × loadFactor
  ```
* Default load factor is 0.75.
* So, with capacity 16:

    * Resize happens when size > 12.

---

### 💡 Simple Analogy:

Think of a classroom:

* If you keep putting more students into a small classroom, it gets crowded and noisy.
* Doubling the number of classrooms (buckets) gives space to spread out — fewer students (entries) per room (bucket) = better learning (faster operations).

---------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION: ok then what is the meaning of collision then each student will have his own hash code then what is the problem

Fantastic — you're asking the right questions! 🙌

Yes, **each student (key)** has a **hash code**, but here's the key detail:

> 🔥 **Multiple keys can have different hash codes but still land in the same bucket.**
> That’s a **collision**.

---

### 🎯 What is a Collision?

A **collision** occurs when **two different keys** generate **hash codes that, after processing**, map to the **same bucket index**.

---

### 🔧 Behind the Scenes:

Let’s break it down:

1. `hashCode()` generates an integer (can be different for different keys).
2. Java applies **hash spreading** (bit manipulation) to mix the hash.
3. Final bucket index is calculated as:

   ```java
   index = (capacity - 1) & hash;
   ```

👉 So **many hash codes can still map to the same index** due to the modulus-like operation (bit masking).

---

### 🧠 Example:

Assume capacity = 16 → valid bucket indexes: 0–15

| Key       | hashCode | hash (after mixing) | Bucket Index = (16 - 1) & hash |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `"Ram"`   | 112345   | 10101101001110101   | 5                              |
| `"Shyam"` | 991234   | 11011011001100100   | 5                              |

🔁 **Collision occurred at index 5**, even though `"Ram"` and `"Shyam"` have different hash codes.

---

### 🎓 Analogy:

* Imagine 100 students (keys), each has a **unique student ID (hash code)**.
* But you only have **16 classrooms (buckets)**.
* Multiple students will end up in the **same classroom** because:

  ```java
  classroom = studentId % 16;
  ```

  → That’s a **collision**.

---

### 🚨 Why Collisions Matter

If many collisions happen:

* All entries go into the same bucket (linked list/tree).
* Lookup time grows: from **O(1)** to **O(n)** or **O(log n)**.
* That’s why **good hash functions** and **resizing** (to reduce collisions) are important.

---

----------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION: ok then how we can comeup from collission

Great — you're now at the heart of **HashMap optimization**! Let's break down **how to reduce or handle collisions** effectively:

---

## ✅ How to Deal With or Reduce Collisions in a HashMap

### 1. **Use a Good Hash Function**

A well-distributed hash function reduces the chance of two keys mapping to the same index.

* Java uses `hashCode()` → but it **improves it** using:

  ```java
  hash = (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);
  ```
* This avoids clustering of hash codes that only differ in the lower bits.

📌 **You should:**

* Ensure your `hashCode()` implementation (if custom) uses a good mix of fields.
* Override `hashCode()` and `equals()` properly if using custom keys.

---

### 2. **Resize the HashMap**

HashMap resizes (doubles capacity) automatically when:

```java
size > capacity * loadFactor
```

Default load factor = 0.75

* More buckets → lower collision chance.
* But resizing is **costly**, so it’s done cautiously.

You can control this by:

```java
new HashMap<>(initialCapacity, loadFactor);
```

---

### 3. **Treeification (Java 8+)**

If one bucket has too many entries (i.e., > 8), Java converts the **linked list** to a **Red-Black Tree**, which makes lookup faster:
🔁 From O(n) → **O(log n)**

But treeification happens only if total capacity ≥ 64.

---

### 4. **Avoid Poorly Distributed Keys**

Example of bad practice:

```java
"abc1", "abc2", "abc3"...
```

If `hashCode()` just looks at digits, all may map to same index.

Better: Use more entropy-rich or unique fields in key, e.g., UUIDs, timestamps, etc.

---

### 5. **Use Alternative Maps If Needed**

* `LinkedHashMap` → maintains order but still uses hash-based lookup.
* `TreeMap` → avoids hashing entirely; uses a sorted tree (no collisions, but slower).

---

### 📌 Summary

| Technique              | Purpose                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Good `hashCode()`      | Spread keys evenly           |
| Resizing               | Add more buckets             |
| Treeification          | Speed up bad collision cases |
| Avoid bad key patterns | Reduce clustering            |
